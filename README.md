You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

If you've ever felt your inner chef egging you to try something new in the kitchen, Recipes Please gets you halfway there. This application allows users to generate, experiment with, and save unique recipes! Users can generate recipes from an existing library of ingredients, or they can add their own. Recipes Please will cook up sweet combinations that might just become your favorites!

### Design

The images above show the log in page and main application page respectively.

### Key features

- Quotes are displayed on the home page.
- Users can log in to use application to generate recipes and see who else has generated recipes.
- In the ingredients section, users can select which ingredients they want to include in the recipe generator.
- In the recipe generator section, users can generate recipes with the selected ingredients and save the recipes to their account's library.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - For a log in page and main recipe generation page will use correct HTML structure
- **CSS** - For clean styling choices throughout the application, including colors, spacing, animation, etc.
- **React** - For user log in, interacting with ingredient library, recipe nodes, and the buttons to generate, edit, and save recipes
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
        - adding number of recipes generated to user library database
        - adding recipes to user library database
        - retrieving and displaying other users' number of recipes saved
        - displaying quotes 
        - register, login, and logout users; users cannot generate recipes unless logged in
- **DB/Login** - stores authentication information and recipes in database
- **WebSocket** - Users will see when other users generate and save recipes
